# 🌍 Language Translation Models

![Language Translation](images/translation_banner.png)

This repository contains multiple projects focused on language translation, including English-to-French and English-to-Spanish models. It features cutting-edge deep learning techniques and a user-friendly GUI to facilitate translation tasks.

## 🚀 Features

- **English-to-French Translation**: A neural network model that translates English sentences into French.
- **English-to-Spanish Translation**: A neural network model that translates English sentences into Spanish.
- **Image to Text**: A tool for converting images into text.
- **Interactive GUI**: A Tkinter-based GUI for easy interaction with the translation models.
- **Web Application**: A Flask web app to perform translations directly in the browser.

## 🎓 How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Language-Translation-Models.git
   cd Language-Translation-Models

## 🎯 Future Work

1. **Expand the language models to support more languages**:
   - Train and integrate new models for additional languages to broaden the translation capabilities of the system.

2. **Improve the accuracy of the existing models**:
   - Enhance model performance by utilizing advanced architectures, tuning hyperparameters, and incorporating more diverse training data.

3. **Add support for more complex sentence structures**:
   - Implement advanced preprocessing techniques and leverage sophisticated model architectures to better handle intricate sentence structures and improve translation quality.
